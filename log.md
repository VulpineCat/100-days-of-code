# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Pleged to 100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts:** I got a few things I want to tackle during 100 Days of Code: I need a portfolio page, two in fact, and I need to make a page for an open source project, a more modern one. I will talk about it in detail once I get there!

### Day 1: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Set up Project 1 (Personal Website).

**Thoughts:** This was more on the organisational side of things, the coding was mostly configurations (and even now those aren't really done yet, but it's getting kind of late)
