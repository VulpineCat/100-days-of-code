# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Joined 100DaysOfCode, cleared some to-dos at work; Refactored Angular code.

**Thoughts:** I got a few things I want to tackle during 100 Days of Code: I need a portfolio page, two in fact, and I need to make a page for an open source project, a more modern one. I will talk about it in detail once I get there!
Additionally, I worked with Angular some today, and boy do I hate it! Looking forward to switching to React. See smaller log for details.

**Link to work:** Sorry the work repo is private :3
