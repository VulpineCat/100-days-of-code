#100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [VulpineCat]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 6, Wed, 2018].

## Log

### R1D0
Quick disclaimer: This project will consist out of one of three projects:
1) My own private website *P#1*
2) My own private portfolio (maybe as part of the website?) *P#2*
3) A website for [VulpineDesigns](https://vulpinedesigns.co.uk/) *P#3*

### R1D1
Mostly busy with project setup. Wrote a quick and dirty placeholder, set up the github project to track this project (P#1). Set up webpack and prettier and a bit of the package.json. Nothing really notable... [Click](https://github.com/VulpineCat/vulpinecat-website)

### R1D2
Lots and lots of devops work. Set up a server at [ZapHosting](https://zap-hosting.com), IP: 134.255.219.180, it's a ubunutu vServer. I've learned about DNS Records and adapted the ones of VulpineCat.com

### R1D3
Today I switched to P#3 instead. I took the current website and made it serve through React via ReactRouter. See the changes [here](https://tinyurl.com/y8dem4ca)

### R1D4
Today I switched to a new project: A pronoun assignment bot for discord. See the code [here](https://github.com/VulpineCat/pronoun-discord-bot) and add it to your server [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=455003833223872512&permissions=268435456&scope=bot) 

### R1D5
Roadblock: I don't know enough CSS to continue. Started [FrontEnd Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) course by [Estelle Weyl](https://twitter.com/estellevw). Coding today was focused on improving the [bot](https://github.com/VulpineCat/pronoun-discord-bot) from yesterday.

### R1D6
Skip
