# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [VulpineCat]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 6, Wed, 2018].

## Log

### R1D0
Quick disclaimer: This project will consist out of one of three projects:
1) My own private website *P#1*
2) My own private portfolio (maybe as part of the website?) *P#2*
3) A website for [VulpineDesigns](https://vulpinedesigns.co.uk/) *P#3*

### R1D1
Mostly busy with project setup. Wrote a quick and dirty placeholder, set up the github project to track this project (P#1). Set up webpack and prettier and a bit of the package.json. Nothing really notable... [Click](https://github.com/VulpineCat/vulpinecat-website)

### R1D2
Lots and lots of devops work. Set up a server at [ZapHosting](https://zap-hosting.com), IP: 134.255.219.180, it's a ubunutu vServer. I've learned about DNS Records and adapted the ones of VulpineCat.com
