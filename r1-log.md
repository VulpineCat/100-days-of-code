# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 6, Wed, 2018].

## Log

### R1D0
Quick disclaimer: This project will consist out of one of three projects:
1) My own private website *P#1*
2) My own private portfolio (maybe as part of the website?) *P#2*
3) A website for [VulpineDesigns](https://vulpinedesigns.co.uk/) *P#3*

### R1D1
Mostly busy with project setup. Wrote a quick and dirty placeholder, set up the github project to track this project (P#1). Set up webpack and prettier and a bit of the package.json. Nothing really notable... [Click](https://github.com/VulpineCat/vulpinecat-website)
